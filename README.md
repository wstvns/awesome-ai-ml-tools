# Awesome AI/ML Tools, APIs & Frameworks [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This is a curated list of incredible tools, APIs, and frameworks in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

I initially put this collection together for my own reference while studying/working with LLMs, RAG, REST APIs, vector processing, and model deployment. Over time, it evolved into a practical and up-to-date guide that I hope can help other developers navigate the ever-expanding AI/ML ecosystem.

That being said, it’s from me when I was a newcomer to this, to me working and studying (making a lot of mistakes) and now to the world.
